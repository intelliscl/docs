The Intellischool Data Platform (IDaP) is a distributed, scalable data platform, capable of providing both transactional and warehouse data storage. Also incorporated into the IDaP are a number of back-end functions aligned with Intellischool's front-end products.

The IDaP's unique multi-tenant architecture enables clients to secure their data within their own tenant sandbox, whilst also enabling parent organisations (such as government departments, school districts or diocesan management bodies) to access and report on data for subordinate tenants.

The data model documentation for the IDaP has not yet been made public. If you would like more information on the IDaP data model, please contact [Developer Support](mailto:help@intellischool.dev).
