The IDaP supports three primary modes of authentication:
1. [__Basic__](/read/api/auth/basic) authentication, for integrations interacting with a single tenant's data;
2. [__OAuth 2.0__](/read/api/auth/oauth2) authentication, for multi-tenant integrations; or
3. [__Learning Tools Interoperability__](/read/lti) authentication.

Learning Tools Interoperability authentication, as well as other LTI principles, are covered in the [Learning Tools Interoperability](/read/lti) section of these docs.
